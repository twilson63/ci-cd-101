    Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment

    CI - Build and Test code using automated tools to merge code as seemlessly as possible.

    CD - Continuous Delivery / Deployment 

        Delivery defines having an automated delivery process but does not define when the application is delivered to production

        Deployment defines a full automated path to deployment when tests are passing, a zero downtime is pushed to production.
